## Installation

### Text Editor
If you don’t have one yet, install a text editor. [Atom](https://atom.io), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are good choices. You can use [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) as used in _inleiding programmeren_ but we don't recommend it.

> Be ware that lecturers may not be able to help you with problems in some specific editors.

### GitHub

If you haven’t already, [sign up for
GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/).

Take some time to set up your [GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile).
Include your name, a profile picture, and a URL to your homepage.
You’re allowed to stay anonymous online for this course by omitting sensitive
information, but a good looking GitHub profile can help you get an internship
or job later.

You will hand in your assignments on GitHub. You can [drag and drop your files](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) via the website but you can also use the [GitHub desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/). We don't really cover using Git and GitHub in this course, feel free to ask other students and your teacher to help get you up and running.

### Brightspace

We use our DLO Brightspace for schedulers and rubric feedback. Make sure you enroll in the _Visual Interface Design 3.2_ course, you can do so by using the [HvA Course Selector][course]. It's important to select the right class for teachers to give you feedback and grades. If you're not sure, ask your teacher to see if you are on the correct classlist.

## Communication

Sign up for our Slack workspace on `cmdminorvisua-dy59487.slack.com`. Join the `#web-animatie` channel in our workspace. Also join `#vid-1` or `#vid-2` depending on your classlist. Get your Slack set up properly, add your  **real name**, **class**, and **GitHub username**. We’ll use this info to link your GitHub and Slack to our administration files. I (Danny) have a _no e-mail policy_, if you have any questions please contact me directly on Slack.

We’d like to use your work as examples for other students and want to inform you about our Code of Conduct for this course. We enforce our Code of Conduct throughout GitHub but also on our Slack.

> If you have technical questions feel free to ask them in Slack but keep the following in mind:
> * Don't use screenshots but link to specific files or snippets in your repo.
> * Accurately describe your problem and let teachers know which solutions you've  already tried.
> * Ask questions in channels instead of direct messaging teachers. Other students might have encountered the same problem and found a solution.

## Introduction
_Introduce yourself to your teacher!_

Wow, you did it! Virtual high five! 🖐 Now [create a **repository**  on GitHub][create] where are your code will live. Then introduce yourself to your teacher and class. Open an issue on our [GitHub issue tracker][issues]. You can pick what are called `issue templates`. Pick the `Introduction` template and fill in the details, then submit.

> 🚨 Make sure you never publicly share you name and student number in combination!

Make sure you hand-in a link to the repository you've created. This will be added to the admin sheet on Brightspace. Also, don't delete this repository after this course is finished. We might want to archive or reference to your cade at a later point!
