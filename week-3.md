### New and shiny

> Play around with some 'new' CSS features

#### Synopsis

*   **Time**: 16:00h
*   **Due**: before _lecture 4_

#### Description

CSS is in constant development and new selectors (features) are being added to the language. Things like clip-path, mix-blend modes, custom properties. It's time to play around with them. The CSS almanac or Codrops Reference are both good starting points. The possibilities are endless so, do experiment! Here are some properties that might be useful, most of these can also be animated:

* CSS Custom Properties
* Clip Paths and Masks
* Font variants (variable fonts)
* Blend modes
* Writing modes

> Try to experiment a bit, see which of these properties are useful for your specific artwork. I encourage you to try at least 3 different properties.
